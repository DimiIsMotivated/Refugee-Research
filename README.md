# Refugee-Research
I did data wrangling and visualization to create a graph of refugee resettlement data, with or without UNHCR assistance

Using R coding, I cleaned a dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unitednations/refugee-data?resource=download
To clean this data, I removed all the NA's from the dataset and summed those values together. These sums became the values plotted in my graph.
To plot my data, I used ggplot2 from the tidyverse library to make a bar chart.
This project is not only important to help understand past trends of refugee traffic, but it is also important to help predict which locations may become refugee hotspots in the future.
